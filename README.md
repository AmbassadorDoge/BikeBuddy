# BikeBuddy

![Render](/media/Render.png)
A separate interface for biking! Features GPS, RTC, and wireless connection. 
With 4 assigned capaciative touch sensors and a 2.41" OLED display, BikeBuddy will be your companion whereever you wish to go!

I wanted to make a device that tracks my biking stats without risking my phone, so this came to be. I needed to make sure it provides enough functionality for it to be useful enough, and with GPS and the Pico providing wireless, this could do it all.
